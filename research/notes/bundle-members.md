# A bundle carries its members to every sheet it reaches

Measured 2026-08-13 against KiCad 10.0.5, while making kicli's net partition
equal KiCad's on the demo corpus. The demos that exposed it are
`demos/kit-dev-coldfire-xilinx_5213` and `demos/royalblue54L_feather`.

## The shape in the corpus

`kit-dev-coldfire-xilinx_5213` runs a bundle `AN[0..7]` from one sheet to
another. On `in_out_conn` a wire named `AN0` reaches the connector; on the
processor sheet a wire named `AN0` reaches `U102` pin 43. No wire joins the
two, and neither does a label of a kind that crosses sheets. KiCad puts both
pins on one net, `/AN0`. kicli had them on two.

`royalblue54L_feather` does the same with groups: `ANALOG{A[0..5]}` carries
`ANALOG.A0` to `ANALOG.A5`, and `I2C{SCL, SDA}` carries `I2C.SCL` and
`I2C.SDA`.

## What was measured

A root sheet and one child. The bundle leaves the root through the child's
port. Each sheet carries two named wires with a resistor on each.

| Cluster | The name on both sheets | `kicad-cli sch export netlist` says |
|---|---|---|
| a | `AN0`, a member of the bundle `AN[0..7]` | `/child/AN0` = `R1.1 R2.1` — **one net across the two sheets** |
| b | `ZZ9`, which no bundle carries | `/ZZ9` = `R5.1` and `/child/ZZ9` = `R6.1` — two nets |

Cluster (b) is the control: an equal name on two sheets is two nets, as a
local label always is. The bundle is the whole of the difference.

Two more probes fix the shape of the rule:

- **No wire is needed.** In cluster (a) neither named wire touches the bundle.
  A second probe with bus entries joining the wires to the bundle gives the
  same partition.
- **A group names its members with a stop.** `ANALOG{A[0..5]}` carries
  `ANALOG.A0`, measured on the same two-sheet drawing.

## The rule, as KiCad implements it

`CONNECTION_GRAPH::processSubGraphs` (`eeschema/connection_graph.cpp`) walks
each bundle's members and links every same-sheet net subgraph whose driver
name is one of them:

```cpp
if( member->IsBus() )
    connections_to_check.insert( end, member->Members().begin(), member->Members().end() );
...
subgraph->m_bus_neighbors[member].insert( candidate );
```

`propagateToNeighbors` then carries the member along the bundle, and the
bundle reaches the child sheet through its port. The member names come from
`SCH_CONNECTION::ConfigureFromLabel` with `NET_SETTINGS::ParseBusVector` and
`ParseBusGroup`.

## What it means for kicli

kicli merges every bundle item into classes as it does any other item, then,
for each class, expands the member names of every bundle name in it and joins
the like-named nets on every sheet that class reaches.

## Open, and the reason the corpus is not yet exact

**Two bundles of different names, wired together, share their members.** In
`royalblue54L_feather` the root sheet wires the port `UART{TX, RX}` of one
child to the port `UART_TRG{TX, RX}` of two others, and KiCad puts `UART.RX`
and `UART_TRG.RX` on one net. `demos/video` does the same at scale:
`VRAM[0..31]` and `DQ[0..31]` are wired together on the root sheet, and
`VRAM31` and `DQ31` are one net.

Four probes failed to reproduce it, and each is recorded here so the next
attempt does not repeat them:

1. two vectors, `AA[0..3]` and `BB[0..3]`, wired together on the root, with
   `AA1` and `BB1` on the two children — two nets;
2. the same with bus entries joining each named wire to its bundle — two nets;
3. two groups, `AA{P Q}` and `BB{P Q}`, with `AA.P` and `BB.P` — two nets;
4. the same with bus entries — two nets.

So the correspondence is neither by position in the member list nor by the
member's own name, under the conditions tried. Until it is measured, kicli
joins members only where the names agree, and three demo hierarchies —
`royalblue54L_feather`, `video` and `vme-wren` — differ from KiCad by the
nets that cross from one bundle name to another.

## Reproduction

```sh
# A root sheet and one child, the bundle AN[0..7] between them, and the name
# AN0 on a wire of each sheet; ZZ9 on a wire of each sheet as the control.
kicad-cli sch export netlist -o probe.net probe.kicad_sch
grep -A8 '"/child/AN0"' probe.net   # two pins
grep -A4 '"/ZZ9"'       probe.net   # one pin
```

`cargo test --test net_probe_rules` builds that drawing and holds the rule in
place. With `KICLI_TEST_KICAD_CLI` set it exports the netlist as well, so the
expectation above is checked against the tool rather than remembered.
